SVI ranks each U.S. census tract on 15 social factors, which are then grouped into four related themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial and ethnic minority status and language, and housing type and transportation. SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every census tract as a percentile ranking ranging from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater vulnerability. The overall tract summary ranking variable was used to categorize four quartiles of vulnerability: Scores from 0 to 0.2500 are categorized as \"little to no social vulnerability, \" 0.2501-0.500 are \"low social vulnerability, \" 0.5001-0.7500 are \"medium social vulnerability, \" and 0.7501-1.0 are \"high social vulnerability.\" Estimates based on 2019-2021 data use 2018 SVI values, and estimates based on 2022 data use 2020 SVI values.
